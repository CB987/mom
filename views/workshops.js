        <h6>I teach several different classes online through these forums:</h6>
        <h6>Master Class With Elizabeth Barton</h6>
        <p> Please <a href="mailto:elizabethmasterclass@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you are interested in more details of the class. 
        The Master Class is a year long commitment, with assignments most months, critiquing, and a private blog.
        I'm happy to send you full details and answer any questions.
        
        You can also take the class as an independent student for 6 or 12 months - taking advantage of support, critiques, goals, advice etc as needed and desired! I am an honest critic, but a supportive one ...I want to help you forward in your own journey of improvement.
        
        I'm developing my online teaching more and more, and am always thinking up ideas for a new class. So, do let me know if there's a class you're looking for that doesn't yet exist!! If I'm interested in the topic, I'll definitely consider writing one on it.</p>
