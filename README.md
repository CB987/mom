<p>My mom is an internationally-known and award-winning fiber artist (not to brag). I am rebuilding her website and adding PayPal functionality so it is easier for her to sell online. Her current site is a drag-and-drop builder which does not do justice to her amazing work. </p>

<h4>MVP</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Just make it look better, add some css, make sure things line up with each other and are consistent across pages</li>
    <li>PayPal</li>
    <li>Need to fix header so it works on safari too... https://css-tricks.com/css-techniques-and-effects-for-knockout-text/ </li>
  </ul>
<h4>technologies used</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript w/ Node.js and Express</li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>future upgrades</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>v1.5 get her blog feed on the front page? or at least a link</li>
  <li>v2. build w/ React </li>
  <li>v3. w/ SQL backend </li>
  <li>v4. w/ UI that mom can add to... image list items, awards/publications list items, text????</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So you can see that my mom's site is actually my playground and testing site, only with the accountability that it is actually a real site, so it may never be truly finished, as the more I learn, the more I come up with upgrades for it. Currently deployed at  <a href="https://elizabethbarton.knitscode.com" target="blank">elizabethbarton.knitscode.com</a> until it is ready for the general public.</p>
