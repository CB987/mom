<p>My mom is an internationally-known and award-winning fiber artist (not to brag). I am rebuilding her website and adding PayPal functionality so it is easier for her to sell online. Her current site is a drag-and-drop builder which does not do justice to her amazing work. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Just make it look better, add some css, make sure things line up with each other and are consistent across pages</li>

  </ul>
